## I see candles but my indicator doesn't show — what's wrong?

You almost certainly haven't registered a scripting engine. **Vela™ ships none** — a bare chart is candles, drawings and native indicators only. Install an engine and register it before (or any time before) you add an indicator:

```js
import { PineEngine } from '@luxalgo/vela-pinets'; // npm i @luxalgo/vela-pinets pinets
chart.registerEngine('pine', new PineEngine());
```

Calling `addIndicator` for a language with no registered engine throws an actionable error rather than silently doing nothing. See [Scripting engines](./scripting-engines.md) and [quickstart.md](./quickstart.md).

## Can I use Vela™ fully offline, with no API key?

Yes — pass your own bars via the `data` option. No network call, no key, nothing to configure:

```js
new Vela('#chart', { data: myBars, timeframe: '1h' });
```

`data` and provider fetch are mutually exclusive. With offline `data`, `timeframe` is still used for bar spacing and axis labels; `symbol`/`bars` are ignored. This is the recommended path for first runs, demos, and tests. See [examples.md](./examples.md).

## How does live mode work?

Set `live: true`. On top of the loaded history, the chart subscribes to ticks: the forming (last) candle updates in place, and a new bar is appended when the interval rolls over. Indicators recompute as bars change, and you can observe ticks with `chart.on('bar', …)`. The forming bar is never cached as closed history. Live updates come from a data provider: bars you pass as `data` have no source of ticks, so they stay exactly as given even with `live: true`. To stream real updates onto your own bars, register a [data provider](./data-providers.md) that implements `subscribe`.

## How do I turn off caching?

The default feed (a multi-provider registry) caches closed bars in memory, so re-runs for the same symbol reuse bars and only re-fetch the tail. Caching is built into that feed and isn't separately toggleable. To bypass it entirely, inject your own bare `MarketDataFeed` through the deps swap point — a custom feed is used as-is, with no registry and no auto-cache:

```js
new Vela('#chart', options, { dataFeed: myCustomFeed });
```

See [Adding a data provider](../contributing/adding-a-data-provider.md) for the provider model and the feed contract, and [Data providers](./data-providers.md) for registering providers with `chart.data`.

## Which renderer and which engine should I use?

**Renderer:** the **native** renderer is the default (WebGL2 with a canvas2d fallback) and the only bundled backend; a custom `IChartRenderer` class can replace it wholesale.

**Engine:** none is bundled — you install one. For Pine Script, the `@luxalgo/vela-pinets` addon exports two forms with identical semantics:

- **In-process** (`PineEngine`) — runs on the main thread; simplest setup.
- **Web-Worker** (`PineWorkerEngine`) — the same Pine, off the main thread, which **keeps the UI responsive** during heavy computation. It streams live exactly like the in-process form: a persistent session lives inside the worker, so each tick sends one bar across and the script updates incrementally.

Register whichever form you want under the `pine` language id — the call site is identical:

```js
import { PineWorkerEngine } from '@luxalgo/vela-pinets';
chart.registerEngine('pine', new PineWorkerEngine());
```

Default to the worker form; reach for the in-process one when you want the simplest possible setup or a debugger stepping through engine code on the main thread. For any other language, write an engine against the [port](../contributing/adding-an-engine.md).

## My drawings don't appear, or I can't edit them — why?

Interactive drawing needs a renderer that supports it. The **native** renderer does; the
a minimal adapter may not. Check `chart.drawings.supported` — when it's `false`, the
interactive methods warn and no-op (and the toolbar won't show), but `chart.drawings.add(...)`,
`toJSON()`/`fromJSON()`, and `undo()`/`redo()` still work, because the drawing model is core-owned.

## Do my drawings persist across reloads?

Not automatically. Snapshot them with `chart.drawings.toJSON()`, store the document yourself
(localStorage, your backend, …), and restore with `chart.drawings.fromJSON(doc)`. Anchors are in
time + price, so restored drawings land on the right bars regardless of the current zoom. See
[drawing-tools.md](./drawing-tools.md).

## How do I hide the toolbar but still script drawings?

Construct with `drawings: false` (or call `chart.drawings.showToolbar(false)`). The bar disappears,
but the whole `chart.drawings` API keeps working headlessly.

## How do I draw my own filled shapes and labels on the chart?

Pick the route by who owns the shape:

- **Shapes the user can see and edit** — add drawing tools from code:
  `chart.drawings.add('box', { anchors })` for a filled rectangle, `'polyline'` for a
  polygon, `'text'` for a label, and `'position'` for a risk/reward box with entry, stop and
  target. Lock one with `chart.drawings.lock(id)` to keep it from being edited. See
  [driving drawings from code](./drawing-tools.md#driving-drawings-from-code).
- **Shapes your script computes** — an indicator script draws boxes, polylines, labels, lines
  and fills through its engine (Pine Script's `box.new`, `polyline.new`, `label.new`, …), and
  they follow the indicator through recomputes, replays and pane moves.
- **Your own overlay graphics** — register a renderer layer with the plugin SDK. The layer gets
  its own canvas, repainted with the chart, with the time and price to pixel mapping, so the
  shapes stay aligned through pans, zooms and redraws. See
  [renderer layers](../contributing/plugin-sdk.md#renderer-layers--registerrendererlayer).

## Why doesn't a horizontal line's title show on the chart?

A horizontal line from a script (Pine Script's `hline()`) draws the line only: the chart
keeps its `title` but never paints it. To put text next to a level, draw a label at that
price.

## Can I remove the in-chart Vela™ logo?

The bottom-left mark is Vela™'s **attribution notice** (see the repository's `NOTICE`
file, per Apache-2.0 §4(d)). It renders by default on every chart. You may turn it off —
`chart.renderer.set('attribution', false)` — **only if** you display an equivalent
visible attribution ("Vela™" linking to the project page) elsewhere on the same page or
screen. Removing the attribution entirely is not permitted by the license.

## How stable is the API?

The API is still evolving and may change as the library develops. Expect occasional breaking changes, and pin to a known-good source revision when you need stability.
