# Drawing tools

Vela™ ships an interactive **drawing-tools** layer: a docked toolbar and ~67 on-chart
tools — trend lines, channels, Fibonacci, harmonic patterns, annotations, and more — that a user
draws, edits, and keeps on the chart. Drawings are anchored in **data space** (time + price), so
they stay locked to the bars across pan, zoom, timeframe changes, and reload — the same durability
a scripting engine's own drawing output gets.

The toolbar is **on by default** on the native renderer. Everything it does is also reachable from
code through the [`chart.drawings`](#driving-drawings-from-code) surface, and the whole model
persists to JSON.

> **Drawing tools vs script drawings.** This page is about the *interactive* tools a person places on
> the chart. They are distinct from the lines/boxes/labels an **indicator** emits as output —
> those are part of the neutral model and are covered under indicators.

## The toolbar

A flush vertical bar docked in a gutter on the **left** of the plot (the chart insets to its
right, so the bar never overlaps candles, the legend, or the axes).

- **Tool groups.** Each group is a single cell showing its **last-used** tool's icon. **Click the
  icon** to arm that tool. Multi-tool groups also show a small **arrow** on hover — click the arrow
  to open a **flyout** listing every tool in the group; pick one to arm it (and it becomes the
  group's new last-used icon). Click the arrow again to close the flyout.
- **Cursor.** The top button returns to select/idle (no tool armed).
- **Modes** (bottom of the bar) — renderer-local, mutually exclusive with each other and with any
  armed tool:
  - **Measure** — a transient ruler (click–move–click) that reports the price/%/bar delta. It is
    not saved as a drawing; it clears on the next press, pan, or zoom. **Shift+click** an empty
    spot starts a measurement right there, no toolbar trip needed (press-drag-release works too).
    The magnet snaps both endpoints; a **right-click** or **Escape** cancels an
    in-progress measurement and returns to the pointer (no context menu for that click).
  - **Eraser** — click a drawing to delete it, or press-and-drag across several to wipe them.
  - **Magnet** — a 3-state snap toggle: **off → weak → strong**. *Strong* always snaps a new
    drawing anchor **or measure-ruler endpoint** to the nearest candle's time + OHLC; *weak* snaps
    only when a candle point is within a few pixels of the cursor. Holding **Ctrl/Cmd** is a
    momentary *strong* override.
  - **Stay in drawing mode** — an on/off toggle (pen with a lock, under the magnet). When on,
    finishing a drawing leaves the tool armed so you can keep placing the same tool without
    re-picking it; when off, most tools disarm after one placement (the brush family always stays
    armed either way). Click the cursor button or press Escape to return to select/idle.
- **Tooltips.** Hovering any control briefly shows a small label beside it; a tool group's
  tooltip names the tool its icon will arm (the group's last-used one).
- **Favorites.** Every tool row in a flyout carries a **star** at its right edge (revealed on row
  hover, gold when set). Starring is a user preference, not document data: the set survives
  symbol/timeframe rebuilds, is persisted by the shell alongside the other UI state (`persist`),
  and is readable and writable from code — see below. Hosts and plugins can build their own UI on
  top of it (a favorites bar, a radial picker…).
- **Shortcut hints.** When the host binds a keyboard shortcut that arms or places a tool, the
  flyout row shows the chord beside the star (the shell binds `Alt+T` for the trend line and
  `Alt+H` / `Alt+V` for lines at the cursor out of the box). Hints are pushed as display strings
  via `chart.drawings.setToolShortcuts({ trendline: 'Alt+T', … })`, so they always match the
  host's actual bindings and platform formatting.

Arm a tool, then **click** to place its anchors (most tools, including shapes, are
click-then-move-then-click; freehand/brush is the exception and captures the drag path; the
polyline takes any number of clicks and finishes on **Enter** or double-click).

**Hold Shift for exact angles.** On the segment line tools (trend line, ray, extended line,
info line, trend angle, arrow), holding **Shift** after the first anchor rounds the line to
the nearest 45° step as drawn on screen — horizontal, vertical, or a perfect diagonal. It
works the same when dragging an endpoint of an existing line, and it temporarily overrides
the magnet so the locked angle is kept exactly.

## Editing a drawing

Select a drawing (click it) to show its **handles** and a compact **quick-settings popup** floating
beside it. The popup is built from each tool's own schema, so it shows only the controls that tool
supports — line color/width/style, fill, text, and (for Fibonacci tools) a **gear** panel to
enable/recolor/label each level. The popup also locks and deletes the drawing, and its overflow
menu (the `⋮` button) duplicates it in place, reorders it (bring-to-front / send-to-back), or
resets its settings. A duplicate lands exactly on its source and becomes the selection, ready to
drag away.

**Text is typed on the chart.** Placing a text annotation opens a blinking caret at the click point
next to an `Enter Text` placeholder, framed by a thin gray box that marks the text as being edited,
and the glyphs appear exactly where they will be painted as you type, at the annotation's default
**large** size. **Enter** starts a new line; a click elsewhere (or **Ctrl/Cmd+Enter**) keeps the
text, and **Escape** restores what was there before — a text annotation that was never typed into is
discarded rather than left invisible. Double-click existing text, or a callout, to reopen the same
inline editor.

Finished text keeps that frame as its selection cue: a plain text annotation shows the same thin box
when it is selected, and a fainter one while the cursor is over it — the words are the drawing, so
the frame is what tells you where it can be clicked, dragged, or restyled.

The quick-settings popup opens alongside the caret, exactly as it does for every other tool. For
annotations whose text _is_ the drawing — text, note, callout, comment, signpost — the text color and
size sit on the popup's bar, so restyling while you type is one click and the words on the chart
follow immediately; reaching for them does not end the edit. **Bold** and **italic** live under the
field behind the popup's **Text** button, next to the text they format. On shapes that merely carry a
label (a trend line, a box), all four controls stay in that panel with the label field.

Drag a handle to reshape; drag the body to move the whole drawing.

### Selecting several drawings

- **Shift+click** or **Ctrl/Cmd+click** a drawing to add it to (or remove it from) the selection.
- **Ctrl/Cmd+drag on an empty spot** sweeps a selection box: every drawing it touches joins the
  selection. Successive boxes accumulate.
- While Ctrl/Cmd is held, handles mark only what is selected — hovering a drawing no longer shows
  them — so the selection you are building is what you see.
- Dragging the body of a selected drawing then moves the **whole selection** together, as one
  undo step; a handle drag still reshapes just that one drawing. Locked members stay where they
  are. The selection survives the drag, and its popup comes back over the moved drawings.
- Delete, nudge, copy, duplicate — and a **middle-click** on any selected drawing — act on the
  whole selection too, each as one undo step.
- A **lock protects a drawing inside a group**: deleting a multi-selection — Delete, middle-click,
  or the popup's trash — removes only its unlocked members; the locked ones stay, still selected.
- Click an empty spot to clear the selection (a drag to pan keeps it).

### One popup for several drawings

Selecting several drawings opens a **single quick-settings popup** for all of them, floating
above their combined extent. It shows only the controls every selected drawing supports: three
trend lines get the full trend-line bar, while a trend line, a box and a text annotation share
just their common ground (text styling, lock, delete, the overflow menu) — controls a member
lacks disappear rather than showing disabled. Where the drawings agree the control reads
normally; where they differ it reads as **mixed**: a color swatch striped with every color in
use, a dash in a dropdown, a half-lit toggle. Any edit applies to every selected drawing as one
undo step, so picking blue from a mixed swatch turns them all blue. Opening a mixed swatch lists
the colors currently in use first, so unifying onto one of them is a single click. The per-drawing
panels — Fibonacci levels, position sizing, volume-profile rows, the text field — stay with a
single selection.

### Duplicating by dragging

**Ctrl/Cmd+drag** a drawing's body to drag a **copy** away from it — the original stays put, the
copy follows the cursor and is committed when you release, with its quick-settings popup open
(one undo step; **Escape** mid-drag leaves nothing behind). With several drawings selected, the
whole selection is copied at once and stays selected as a group.
Ctrl/Cmd on a **handle** keeps its usual meaning — a strong magnet snap while reshaping.

### Keyboard shortcuts

When a drawing is selected (or hovered), with focus on the chart:

| Action | Shortcut |
|---|---|
| Undo | `Ctrl/Cmd + Z` |
| Redo | `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Z` or `Ctrl/Cmd + Y` |
| Copy / Paste / Duplicate | `Ctrl/Cmd + C` / `V` / `D` |
| Delete | `Delete` or `Backspace` |
| Nudge | Arrow keys (1px; `Shift` + arrow = 10px) |
| Cancel placement / measure / clear selection | `Escape` |

Shortcuts stand down while a text field (e.g. a label editor) is focused, so typing is never
hijacked.

Three mouse shortcuts complement these, and need no selection first: **middle-click** a drawing
to delete it, **right-click** while a drawing tool, the ruler, or the eraser is active — placing
or merely armed — to cancel it and return to the pointer (even in stay-in-drawing-mode, and
without opening the chart's context menu for that click; persistent toggles like the magnet and
stay-in-drawing-mode itself are untouched), and **Shift+click** an empty spot to start the
[measure ruler](#the-toolbar) at that point (the magnet still snaps the start).
## Depth: anywhere in the stack

A new drawing starts **just under the price** — the candles read on top of it, the way they read
on top of the indicators — so it behaves like annotation on the chart's background: a zone, a
session band, a shaded area you see *through* the candles rather than across them. From there it
can take **any position in the pane's draw order**: over everything, between two indicators, or
at the very back. (The one exception is a tool whose body *replaces* the series pixels inside its
area — the Magnifier's opaque inset — which starts **above** the whole stack instead, since under
the candles its content would be buried; it can still be reordered afterwards.)

- **From the object tree.** Each pane is one column, read top to bottom as front to back: its
  drawings, its indicators and (in the main pane) the price series, all together. Drag a drawing
  (or a group, which moves as one block) to any slot in that column and the chart repaints in that
  order.
- **From the context menu.** Right-click a drawing row for **Bring to front** / **Send to back** —
  they clear the whole stack, candles and indicators included; a group's row offers the same for
  all of its members at once.
- **From code.** The draw-order key is the drawing's `zIndex`, shared with the pane's series:

```js
chart.drawings.add('box', { anchors }); // a new drawing starts just under the candles
chart.drawings.bringToFront(d.id); // over the whole stack
chart.drawings.sendToBack(d.id); // behind the candles and every indicator
chart.drawings.update(d.id, { zIndex: z }); // an exact slot among the series' keys
```

A drawing under the data stays fully interactive: it still hit-tests, and its selection handles
draw on top, so you can always see and grab what you selected.

The position is part of the drawing, so it is saved with `toJSON()`, restored by `fromJSON()`, and
undoable; the shell also persists the series' own order, so a saved chart comes back stacked as
you left it. Depth needs a renderer that declares the `drawingDepth` capability (the **native
renderer** does); where it is missing, drawings all paint over the data, `zIndex` orders only the
drawings among themselves, and the tree keeps them in one block above the series.

## Tool catalogue

**67 tools across 9 groups.** The **Type key** is the string you pass to
`chart.drawings.setTool('…')` or [`chart.drawings.add('…')`](#driving-drawings-from-code). Eraser,
Magnet, Measure, and Stay in drawing mode are toolbar *modes*, not placeable types, so they have no key.

### Patterns

| Tool | Type key | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| XABCD Pattern | `xabcd` | A 5-point labelled pattern with leg ratios. |
| ABCD Pattern | `abcd` | A 4-point ABCD pattern. |
| Elliott Impulse Wave (1-5) | `elliottimpulse` | A 5-wave impulse labelled 1–5. |

### Forecast & Measure

| Tool | Type key | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Date & Price Range | `datepricerange` | A box reporting the time span + price/% change it covers. |
| Long/Short Position | `position` | An entry/stop/target box: click the entry, then drag in the profit direction (up for a long, down for a short). Shows risk:reward, percentages, dollar loss, and position size from your risk % and account balance (size is editable and back-solves the risk %). The gear panel has a long/short switch (mirrors the levels across the entry), exact level values in price or points, and per-label display toggles; zone colors and label styling sit on the quick bar. |
| Magnifier | `magnifier` | A press-drag-release rectangle whose interior shows the same market at a **lower timeframe**, rendered in the chart's own price style *and colors* (candles, bars, line, area, Heikin Ashi; custom chart types fall back to candles) at true time/price positions. The timeframe chip on the rectangle's bottom-left corner is a dropdown — click it to switch — and the same pick leads the quick bar, beside the up/down color overrides and the border style; **Auto** subdivides the chart's timeframe, and both pickers offer only timeframes below the chart's own. The finer bars load in the background and follow live data; when the chart is already at the finest timeframe, or the area needs more bars than the tool will fetch, a notice inside the rectangle says so. Needs a market with a ranged data source (offline `data` arrays have nothing to fetch). |

## Driving drawings from code

Every chart exposes a `chart.drawings` control surface (a sibling of `chart.renderer` and
`chart.data`). It is chainable, and the model is **core-owned** — so reading/serializing/undo work
even on a renderer that can't paint drawings.

```js
import { Vela } from '@luxalgo/vela';

const chart = new Vela('#chart', { data: bars });
await chart.ready();

// Arm a tool so the next clicks place it:
chart.drawings.setTool('trendline');

// …or place one directly (no clicking):
const d = chart.drawings.add('trendline', {
    paneId: 'price',
    anchors: [
        { time: bars[10].time, price: bars[10].low },
        { time: bars[40].time, price: bars[40].high },
    ],
});

chart.drawings.update(d.id, { style: { lineColor: '#ff9800', lineWidth: 2 } });
chart.drawings.lock(d.id);          // make it non-interactive
chart.drawings.showToolbar(false);  // hide the toolbar (drawings still work from code)
```

See the [`chart.drawings` reference](./api-reference.md#chartdrawings-control-surface) for the full
method list and which methods are gated by renderer support.

---

## Tool and mode state from code

The armed tool, the magnet, stay-in-drawing-mode, and the measure/eraser modes are all
readable and drivable programmatically — the seam an external toolbar (e.g. a multi-chart
workspace's shared bar) builds on:

```js
chart.drawings.getTool();               // 'trendline' | … | null (select/idle)
chart.drawings.setSnapMode('strong');   // magnet: 'off' | 'weak' | 'strong'
chart.drawings.getSnapMode();
chart.drawings.setStayMode(true);       // keep the tool armed after each placement
chart.drawings.getStayMode();
chart.drawings.setMode('measure');      // 'measure' | 'eraser' | null (none)
chart.drawings.getMode();

// Follow every change, whatever its source (in-chart toolbar, keyboard, code):
chart.on('drawing:tool', ({ type }) => { /* armed tool changed; null = pointer */ });
chart.on('drawing:snap', ({ mode }) => { /* magnet mode changed */ });
chart.on('drawing:stay', ({ on }) => { /* stay-in-drawing-mode changed */ });
chart.on('drawing:mode', ({ mode }) => { /* measure/eraser entered or left */ });
```

The renderer keeps owning the mutual exclusion — arming a tool exits measure/eraser
(and vice versa), and the outcome always lands on the events, so an external UI only
ever mirrors. One-shot tools disarm themselves after placing (back to `null` on
`drawing:tool`) unless stay-in-drawing-mode is on; the brush family always stays armed.

## Favorite tools

```js
chart.drawings.favorites();                     // ['trendline', 'box'] — starred, in star order
chart.drawings.isFavorite('trendline');         // true
chart.drawings.setFavorite('ray', true);        // star / unstar one type
chart.drawings.setFavorites(['ray', 'box']);    // replace the whole set (unknown types dropped)

chart.on('drawing:favorites', ({ favorites }) => { /* the set changed (star click or code) */ });
```

The shell persists the set with its other state when `persist` is enabled, and restores it on
the next load.

## Persistence, undo & clipboard

- **Save / restore.** `chart.drawings.toJSON()` returns a versioned `DrawingsDocument`; pass it
  back to `chart.drawings.fromJSON(doc)` to restore. The restore path is lenient with untrusted
  input — malformed or unknown-type entries are dropped, never thrown. Drawings are **not**
  auto-persisted; storing the document is up to your app.
- **Undo / redo.** `chart.drawings.undo()` / `redo()` (and `canUndo()` / `canRedo()`) walk a
  snapshot history. A multi-target action (multi-drag, multi-delete, duplicate, paste) is one
  undo step.
- **Clipboard.** `copyToClipboard(ids)` + `paste()`, or `duplicate(ids)` / `clone(id)`, mint fresh
  copies (new ids) and select them — an in-memory, per-chart clipboard. On the chart, the
  popup's overflow menu, **Ctrl/Cmd+D**, and a **Ctrl/Cmd+drag** of the body do the same.

---

## Renderer support

Interactive drawing requires a renderer that declares the `userDrawings` capability — the **native
renderer** does; a minimal custom adapter may not. When unsupported,
`chart.drawings.supported` is `false`, the interactive methods warn and no-op, **but** the
core-owned methods (`add` of the model, `all`, `toJSON`/`fromJSON`, `undo`/`redo`) still work, so a
document round-trips even without an on-chart toolbar.

> **Stability:** the drawing-tools API is young and may change before a 1.0 release. The persisted
> `DrawingsDocument` is versioned and migrated forward.
