/**
 * The single seam between the renderer and a drawing backend. The backend
 * consumes the retained scene + the shared coordinate system and rasterizes the
 * data layer (series, fills, bgcolor, hline, drawing geometry) onto the data
 * canvas. Two implementations sit behind it: `Canvas2dBackend` (primary) and,
 * later, `WebGL2Backend` (hand-rolled, selected when available).
 *
 * The crosshair is NOT the backend's concern — it's a renderer-owned overlay
 * layer (`CrosshairRenderer`) on its own canvas, repainted on the Scheduler's
 * cheap `Cursor` tier without touching the data layer. Neither is the grid: it
 * lives with the session highlights on the renderer-owned backdrop canvas
 * (`BackdropRenderer`) at the very bottom of the pile, so SDK layer canvases
 * stacked below the data canvas still paint above it.
