// The public RENDERER-LAYER registry — the native renderer's extension seam for custom
// canvas layers (the counterpart of the chart-type registry on the data side). A layer owns
// ONE transparent canvas stacked into the chart's layer pile and is repainted from the shared
// paint cycle with the chart's bars, its own native-data channel, and the pane geometry.
//
// Register at IMPORT TIME (before charts are constructed): a renderer instantiates the
// registered layers when it mounts. The layer's `id` doubles as its data channel — the core
// pushes `setNativeData(id, …)` payloads (e.g. from a chart type's SeriesDataEngine via
// `host.pushData`) and `setNativeData(`${id}-pending`, …)` loading ranges; both arrive in the
// layer's render args every frame.
