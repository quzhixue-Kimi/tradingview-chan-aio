// The PANEL DOCK — the one owner of the shell's side-panel column. It holds the shell's own
// panels (object tree, data window) and every contributed one (`registerSidePanel`) as equal
// entries, enforces the single-open rule, projects the toggle buttons into the chrome, and
// carries the dock's persistable state (which panel is open, the widths the user dragged).
//
// Both shells drive the same dock, so the exclusivity rule and the button wiring exist ONCE.
// The chrome is reached through {@link PanelChrome} (the topbar implements it structurally) —
// the dock never imports the topbar, and a different chrome can host the same buttons.
