// The CHART-TYPE registry — the public extension seam for price styles beyond the built-in
// five (candles, bars, line, area, baseline). A chart type may contribute:
//   - a BAR TRANSFORM: a 1:1 time-preserving view over the raw bar stream (Heikin Ashi);
//   - a DATA ENGINE: a per-chart engine that supplies the style's secondary per-bar data
//     to the renderer's native-layer channels (started/suspended as the style is
//     entered/left — the seam an order-flow style plugs into);
//   - an extended-ticker MODIFIER: `"SYM;id"` requests the transformed series from the
//     data plane (`ticker.<id>()` in scripts).
// Registration is global and idempotent-by-id (last registration wins) — plugins register
// once at import time, before or after charts are constructed.
